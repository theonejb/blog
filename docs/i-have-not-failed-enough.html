The first answer was - not too much. I couldn’t think of too many instances of where I had “failed”.</p><p>This was not a good thing. It was very much a sad thing that I couldn’t quickly think of many things I had failed at.</p><h2 id="why-is-not-failing-bad">Why is not failing bad?</h2><p>I realized I didn’t fail a lot because - <strong>I didn’t try a lot.</strong> I didn’t fail because I didn’t have good goals.</p><p>Sure, I have a folder full of projects I thought of, researched, some that I even started working on; that I gave up on pretty soon after starting. <em>But those don’t count as failures right?</em> I was just <em>playing around</em>, not really aiming for anything. It was just a fun side project.</p><p>That’s why I didn’t fail a lot, and that’s also why it’s not a good thing.</p><h2 id="i-need-to-fail-more">I need to fail more</h2><p>Which means that I need to set goals and work towards them. Without goals to aim for, I keep spending my time in the same unproductive loop.</p><ol><li>Think of a shiny new project.<li>Play around a bit, maybe learn a few things.<li>Give up when things get hard or boring.<li>Repeat</ol><p>While I do learn some things, I don’t really learn new things. Picking up another web backend framework when I’m very good at 1 already (Django if you’re looking to get something built 🙂) is very small incremental progress.</p><p>I should be learning about running a business, marketing, sales, how to talk to people, cold calling, etc. Instead I’m playing around with NextJS/Remix because it’s easier to do and there’s very little chance of me failing at it.</p><h2 id="what-im-planning-to-do">What I’m planning to do</h2><ul><li>Any new project that I start, I will have an achievable goal for it. Something that can be called “done”.<ul><li><em>Achievable</em> is different for everyone. Creating a small SaaS and have 5 people pay for it might be childs play for some, it’s my Everest for now.<li>The plan is to aim for things just outside of my reach – to work towards those and grow in the process.</ul><li>Have a deadline. For now I’m starting with 6 week cycles of project work.<li>In order meet deadlines, I need to have a clear picture of the goal. Goes back to the first thing on this list. Having a clear definition of “done” is important. But being able to cut scope to achieve some version of the goal is also important. - I’ve just finished reading Shape Up by Jason Fried and I like the Basecamp approach of deciding on an appetite (time commitment) to a project and cutting scope to meet that appetite. - That’s my plan moving forward. Each project I work on will be “shapped” into an achievable outcome and will have an allocated appetite - when I want to launch it or decide to abandon it. Continuing it for the next 6 week cycle will be another option but should be done sparingly.</ul><p>This approach of timeboxing projects and having an achievable goal is also discussed by Zack Freedman in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1j93RnIxEo">Here’s what’s preventing you from finishing projects</a>. See it when you get the chance.</p><h2 id="this-wasnt-supposed-to-be-a-new-years-resolution">This wasn’t supposed to be a new years resolution</h2><p>I started thinking about this over 2 months ago and have been planning to write a post on it. Today seemed like a good day for it. So I guess this is my new year’s resolution. <strong>Fail more, fail better.</strong></p></main><footer> <a href="/">← Back to all writings</a><div class="bottom-footer"> <i> Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. </i> <i> Theme: <a href="https://knhash.in/jekyllBear" target="_blank">jekyllBear</a>. </i></div></footer>
