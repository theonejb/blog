I’m only going through this to understand if/how I can make it work. This won’t make it into the final template.<ul><li>I was of keeping this as the primary mechanism for authentication. Keeps things simple - and can be changed later if needed. However, further thoughts made me change my mind.<ul><li>Doesn’t require the use of a context to keep an authenticated token to send with all requests.<li>Conversely, the frontend has no way of knowing if it’s authenticated or not without making an API call. With a token, once you have a valid token you’re much more likely to be authenticated.<li>Django has no good way of setting the <code>Partitioned</code> flag on a cookie for now. There’s an issue open (https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34613#comment:1), but no fix yet. Very soon (Q1 2024 according to MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/)) Chrome will roll out 3rd party cookie blocking and there won’t be a simple fix.</ul></ul></ul><li>Cross-domain cookies being phased out and replaced with other technologies to allow the same use case; in our case it’s using cookies to authenticate to our own backend on a different domain.<ul><li>Some further reading on this:<ul><li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/<li>https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd</ul><li>Another very viable alternative (though not as developer friendly for the local development environment) is having the backend and frontend be on the same base domain; api.site.com &amp; www.site.com for example.<ul><li>Will try to check this out as well.</ul></ul><li><strong>Summary</strong><ul><li>I was able to get cross-domain cookies working - will write a blog post with my experiences &amp; thoughts.<li>However, with the constraints I talked about above, that doesn’t seem to be the best way forward.<li>Instead, I’ll transition to using token based authentication.</ul></ul></ul><li>2/23/2024<ul><li>Finished setting up the initial backend &amp; frontend app. Next step is to code the basic integration b/w the two.</ul><li>2/22/2024<ul><li>Completed initial Django project setup with Poetry</ul><li>2/20/2024<ul><li>Asked for feedback on Reddit &amp; updated blog post with Gumroad link.<li>Added build logs to blog.</ul><li>2/20/2024<ul><li>Asked for feedback on Reddit &amp; updated blog post with Gumroad link.<li>Added build log pages to my blog.
