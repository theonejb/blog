I started the day by dumping my thoughts into Logseq. Here they are.</p><p>These are open questions for now. I plan to investigate this further and try out different iterations to see what works for me.</p><ul><li>I’ve been in a place before where I used Roam to gather a small number of notes (&gt; 100) but then found all of that to be an unmanageable mess.<li>Issues that I see with this setup<ul><li>With notes spread all over the place how do I find anything to link to? I can’t go through 200 notes every time I add a new one.<li>All notes are in the same “directory”. Because there is no hierarchy, my notes about productivity are in the same place as my notes about data structures &amp; algorithms. This seems unsustainable.<li>There is 1 benefit I see to this. With everything being in the same place, I can find unexpected connections. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work for me because I don’t go through all my existing notes every time I add a new one.<li>I am interested in many things; productivity, parentings, Islam, algorithms, data structures, system design, programming languages. Having everything in one place seems to add to the mess.<li>As I understand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas Luhmann</a> researched 1 topic extensively - social science. It would make sense for him to keep all his notes in 1 place.</ul><li>The reason I’ve heard repeated for not having a hierarchy:<ul><li>It promotes unexpected connections b/w notes<li>A note isn’t tied to a single category. It can live in multiple places</ul><li>Is that a good enough reason to let go of the organization benefits of a hierarchical structure though?<ul><li>It’s much easier to break down browsing notes to find connections if you can “save your place” in your notes. I can look through the notes in 5 folders today, and go through the 5 others later.<li>Notes about the same thing fit differently in different categories. I can take 1 idea and have it fit differently in my notes on parenting and in my notes on productivity. It’s easy to copy and link notes together with our digital systems. I can even symlink the same note to multiple places in the hierarchy.</ul><li>Zettelkasten also has index notes. Folders essentially serve the same purpose.<li>Questions I have<ul><li>Did Luhmann succeed because of his slip box, or in spite of it? Are there other examples of successful writers using such a system?<li>Are slip boxes supposed (who decides?) to hold notes on disparate topics?<li>How do people with large slip boxes navigate? Do they use index cards? If so, can I use folders to serve the same purpose as well as reduce the mental load of browsing through my knowledge base?<ul><li>How did Luhmann manage his slip box with 90K notes? I can’t imagine he went through all 90K notes every time he added a new one.</ul></ul><li>I imagine most courses around “building a 2nd brain” or “cultivating your knowledge garden” answer this question. I haven’t taken any yet, but I plan to. That knowledge might change my perspective on this.<li>Roam/Logseq vs. Obsidian<ul><li>Logseq is very structured. Everything is a bullet point. This provides a number of benefits to me.<ul><li>Writing is much easier. With a forced structure in place, I can think in outlines and short paragraphs, without getting into the weed of how to structure my writing.<li>If every thing is a block, I can easily reference other blocks inline with my writing.<li>I can write queries that show me subsets of my blocks. For example I have a query to show me all notes with a “status:: incomplete” tag on my dashboard.</ul><li>The feature I like most about Logseq is the daily journal. I can write everything there and have it show up in different places. I was attracted to Roam due to this as well.<ul><li>It’s great for gathering data and thinking, but didn’t work out for me when consolidating and keeping long term.</ul><li>Obsidian offers free form writing. It’s not as great to think in, but I feel that it offers a better experience once the thinking is done and I’m writing the final artifact.<li>Artifacts can be permanent notes, but also blog posts and other long form pieces.<li>Here’s what I’m thinking of adapting<ul><li>Temporary notes go in Logseq. These are fleeting notes, literature notes, my daily journals with todo items.<li>Once I’ve gathered data and thought about it in Logseq, the final artifacts go into Obsidian, where they are neatly categorized in folders for easy browsing. I can then link b/w notes in Obsidian as well, using the folder hierarchy to easy searching.<li>Because doing the same thing that I did in Roam again in Logseq isn’t useful. I’ll end up repeating the same situation where I get to a few 100 notes and then declare bankruptcy.</ul></ul></ul></main><footer> <a href="/">← Back to all writings</a><div class="bottom-footer"> <i>Theme <a href="https://knhash.in/jekyllBear" title="the art">jekyllBear</a> built and maintained by <a href="https://knhash.in" title="the artist">knhash</a> </i></div></footer>
