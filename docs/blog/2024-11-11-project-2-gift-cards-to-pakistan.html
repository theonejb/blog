I found a number of very good options. They all had websites that inspired confidence, and used robust payment methods (Stripe in my example) that I could trust with my credit card.</p><p>I recently had to send a gift card to a colleague in Pakistan. I was confident that I would find a bunch of great options; instead I only <a href="https://www.giftkarte.com/" target="_new">found one</a> that I could think of trusting with my money.</p><p>I ended up using their services and the card was delivered, but there were a number of problems I saw:</p><ul><li>No trust building around card payments. There was no clear mention of which provider they used. I did a bank transfer instead of using a CC. This meant my payment was manually verified and the card was only sent after a few hours.<li>There was no confirmation email about my order. I was worried enough to call their helpline to confirm that my order had gone through.<li>Once they had sent the card (which I also had to confirm via phone), I only got a confirmation email the next day.<li>To get an invoice to expense this, I had to send them an email. I‚Äôm still waiting on an invoice.<li>There were multiple colleagues who chipped in on this gift card. I had to collect the money from them and then pay for the card myself. In my previous experience of sending a gift card to the UK, I was able to include my colleagues in the process. They were able to add their contributions directly to the gift card I selected and a card of the total amount was sent to the recipient.<li>Finally, there was no option for the receiver to choose which gift card they wanted. Instead I had to choose for them. There is a ‚ÄúUniversal Gift Card‚Äù they claim works at all merchants and is the one I got, but redeeming that would be slightly more complicated.</ul><p>Interestingly, my colleague didn‚Äôt open the email they received with the gift card because they thought it was a spam/scam/malicious email. Only after I asked if they had received the card did they end up opening it.</p><p>I know a better user experience exists. I want to bring the same to Pakistan and solve my own problem at the same time.</p><p>Is there a market for this? I believe so, because:</p><ul><li>It‚Äôs a problem I‚Äôve just faced.<li>I‚Äôve seen my wife having to deal with low-trust companies sending gifts to Pakistan. Gift cards are different, but eventually I could also add the option to send physical gifts to the recipient.<li>I‚Äôve seen my employer deal with this. Recently a baby gift basket arrived 2 months after the baby was born. ü§Ø<li>This is a recurring problem. People &amp; companies need to send gift cards on birthdays, weddings, etc.<li>With more companies starting to hire remotely in Pakistan, this could be a valuable service for businesses to subscribe to.</ul><h2 id="validation">Validation?</h2><p>I haven‚Äôt found an easy way to validate this idea. There is no community of ‚Äúpeople sending gift cards to Pakistan‚Äù that I can tap into. That isn‚Äôt a cohort I can find in one place.</p><p>I could make a list of B2B customers; companies that hire remotely in Pakistan.</p><p>However, I want to start with individual customers - because I‚Äôm starting from a place of solving my own problem. It should be possible to pivot to B2B if I don‚Äôt find any interest from individual customers.</p><p>Validation then involves me starting with a blog - suggesting gift cards to send to Pakistan. I‚Äôll use SEO to bring in traffic. If I see enough visitors, I could start building a business. This also means that if/when the actual product launches, I‚Äôll have a distribution channel already working.</p><h2 id="what-if-im-wrong">What if I‚Äôm wrong?</h2><p>There‚Äôs a <strong>very strong</strong> possibility that I‚Äôm wrong about this idea. That I‚Äôll spend a bunch of time for it to get nowhere, or that I have picked a problem that isn‚Äôt very valuable to solve.</p><p>This is my unique brand of fear of failure. I used to think I didn‚Äôt fear failing, because I had already failed many times. Instead, my fear of failure manifests as a fear of picking the wrong thing and wasting time on it. The way I am dealing with this is to realize that if I don‚Äôt pick anything - which I have frequently done in the past - I have an <strong>exactly</strong> 0% chance of succeeding. Just trying something makes that probability &gt; 0%.</p><blockquote><p>You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take.</p></blockquote><p>Another thing that‚Äôs helping me is to time box this idea. I will spend 6 weeks on building the blog and populating it with as much useful content as possible. After that I can spend an hour or two every week to add a few more pieces of content. I can start researching and working on a different idea after the 6 week period and wait for the SEO to have an impact before making a decision to continue or abandon this.</p></main><footer> <a href="/">‚Üê Back to all writings</a><div class="bottom-footer"> <i> Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. </i> <i> Theme: <a href="https://knhash.in/jekyllBear" target="_blank">jekyllBear</a>. </i></div></footer>
