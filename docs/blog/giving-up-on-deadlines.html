I’d be working for hours on my side projects almost every day. Slowly however, this changed. I found new hobbies, started hanging out with friends, got married, became a father.</p><p>Life got in the way.</p><p>Looking back over the past 2 years, I don’t think I’ve finished any side project, of any size. That realization hit me like a brick a few days ago.</p><p>Something has to change.</p><h2 id="my-failed-system">My failed system</h2><p>Up till now, I’ve tried to follow good task management practices.</p><p>I would break down a project into smaller tasks, made sure I wasn’t doing too much (build an MVP), and assigned deadlines to the tasks.</p><p>Problem is, deadlines don’t work for me when I’m the one who has to enforce them. These are soft deadlines. They would approach and I would push them forward by a week or two. Until a year had passed by and I couldn’t get through watching the 3 videos that would complete that course I started a year ago.</p><p>Deadlines only work for me when they are hard deadlines, like the kind at work where they mean something. A commitment to an external stakeholder, with real consequences for missing them.</p><p>Life getting in the way of side projects is not a bad thing, but because I had assigned deadlines to the tasks, not being able to complete them on the assigned day made me feel like a failure.</p><p>I had free time, but I would spend it watching TV or doing irrelevant things, because I couldn’t get myself to start on the tasks for my side projects, maybe because I feared I would fail to complete them by their new deadline anyway.</p><h2 id="my-new-system">My new system</h2><p>I’m giving up on deadlines for my personal side projects.</p><p>Instead, I’m just going to have a list of in-progress projects. Each project is broken down into tasks, and every project has a next task that I can just pick up and go. Whenever I find free time, I’m going to pick one task from one project and work on it.</p><p>Deadlines don’t work for me because they are soft deadlines. So I’m getting rid of them.</p><p>Deadlines do serve another important role however, which I have another way of replicating.</p><p>Deadlines give you a finite amount of time to work on something, so you come up with a version of the solution that can be done in that time. Without a deadline, you could keep working on just one task, trying to complete it to perfection.</p><p>I’m replacing that with a well defined definition of <strong>DONE</strong> for my side projects before I start working on them.</p><p>The definition of done should lead to an MVP, a small but working version of whatever it is I’m trying to build. This will serve the same purpose as a deadline, but without the artificial constraint of time or the feeling of failure when life get’s in the way and I have to move the deadline.</p><p>I’m starting on that now. This blog post is the first step in my journey towards this new system. I’ll check back in a few months to see how much progress I’ve made on my projects with this new way of working.</p></main><footer> <a href="/">← Back to all writings</a><div class="bottom-footer"> <i> Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. </i> <i> Theme: <a href="https://knhash.in/jekyllBear" target="_blank">jekyllBear</a>. </i></div></footer>
