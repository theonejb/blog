I've completed a freelance project I was working on for a few months, and have started saying no to new opportunities. _It's time to work on one of my own ideas again._ This is part of my plan to [start failing more]({% post_url 2023-12-31-i-have-not-failed-enough %}).

I've decided to build a business sending gift cards to Pakistan - and eventually other countries in that corner of the world.

## Why?
A few years ago I had sent a gift card to a colleague in the UK. I found a number of very good options. They all had websites that inspired confidence, and used robust payment methods (Stripe in my example) that I could trust with my credit card.

I recently had to send a gift card to a colleague in Pakistan. I was confident that I would find a bunch of great options; instead I only <a href="https://www.giftkarte.com/" target="_new">found one</a> that I could think of trusting with my money.

I ended up using their services and the card was delivered, but there were a number of problems I saw:
- No trust building around card payments. There was no clear mention of which provider they used. I did a bank transfer instead of using a CC. This meant my payment was manually verified and the card was only sent after a few hours.
- There was no confirmation email about my order. I was worried enough to call their helpline to confirm that my order had gone through.
- Once they had sent the card (which I also had to confirm via phone), I only got a confirmation email the next day.
- To get an invoice to expense this, I had to send them an email. I'm still waiting on an invoice.
- There were multiple colleagues who chipped in on this gift card. I had to collect the money from them and then pay for the card myself. In my previous experience of sending a gift card to the UK, I was able to include my colleagues in the process. They were able to add their contributions directly to the gift card I selected and a card of the total amount was sent to the recipient.
- Finally, there was no option for the receiver to choose which gift card they wanted. Instead I had to choose for them. There is a "Universal Gift Card" they claim works at all merchants and is the one I got, but redeeming that would be slightly more complicated.

Interestingly, my colleague didn't open the email they received with the gift card because they thought it was a spam/scam/malicious email. Only after I asked if they had received the card did they end up opening it.

I know a better user experience exists. I want to bring the same to Pakistan and solve my own problem at the same time.

Is there a market for this? I believe so, because:
- It's a problem I've just faced.
- I've seen my wife having to deal with low-trust companies sending gifts to Pakistan. Gift cards are different, but eventually I could also add the option to send physical gifts to the recipient.
- I've seen my employer deal with this. Recently a baby gift basket arrived 2 months after the baby was born. ðŸ¤¯
- This is a recurring problem. People & companies need to send gift cards on birthdays, weddings, etc.
- With more companies starting to hire remotely in Pakistan, this could be a valuable service for businesses to subscribe to.

## Validation?
I haven't found an easy way to validate this idea. There is no community of "people sending gift cards to Pakistan" that I can tap into. That isn't a cohort I can find in one place.

I could make a list of B2B customers; companies that hire remotely in Pakistan.

However, I want to start with individual customers - because I'm starting from a place of solving my own problem. It should be possible to pivot to B2B if I don't find any interest from individual customers.

Validation then involves me starting with a blog - suggesting gift cards to send to Pakistan. I'll use SEO to bring in traffic. If I see enough visitors, I could start building a business. This also means that if/when the actual product launches, I'll have a distribution channel already working.

## What if I'm wrong?
There's a **very strong** possibility that I'm wrong about this idea. That I'll spend a bunch of time for it to get nowhere, or that I have picked a problem that isn't very valuable to solve.

This is my unique brand of fear of failure. I used to think I didn't fear failing, because I had already failed many times. Instead, my fear of failure manifests as a fear of picking the wrong thing and wasting time on it. The way I am dealing with this is to realize that if I don't pick anything - which I have frequently done in the past - I have an **exactly** 0% chance of succeeding. Just trying something makes that probability > 0%.

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Another thing that's helping me is to time box this idea. I will spend 6 weeks on building the blog and populating it with as much useful content as possible. After that I can spend an hour or two every week to add a few more pieces of content. I can start researching and working on a different idea after the 6 week period and wait for the SEO to have an impact before making a decision to continue or abandon this.
