I was recently listening through the [How to succeed at failing](https://freakonomics.com/podcast-tag/how-to-succeed-at-failing/) series on the Freakonomics podcast and started to think about how often I had failed in the past few years. The first answer was - not too much. I couldn't think of too many instances of where I had "failed".

This was not a good thing. It was very much a sad thing that I couldn't quickly think of many things I had failed at.

## Why is not failing bad?
I realized I didn't fail a lot because - **I didn't try a lot.** I didn't fail because I didn't have good goals.

Sure, I have a folder full of projects I thought of, researched, some that I even started working on; that I gave up on pretty soon after starting. _But those don't count as failures right?_ I was just _playing around_, not really aiming for anything. It was just a fun side project.

That's why I didn't fail a lot, and that's also why it's not a good thing.

## I need to fail more
Which means that I need to set goals and work towards them. Without goals to aim for, I keep spending my time in the same unproductive loop.
1. Think of a shiny new project.
2. Play around a bit, maybe learn a few things.
3. Give up when things get hard or boring.
4. Repeat

While I do learn some things, I don't really learn new things. Picking up another web backend framework when I'm very good at 1 already (Django if you're looking to get something built ðŸ™‚) is very small incremental progress.

I should be learning about running a business, marketing, sales, how to talk to people, cold calling, etc. Instead I'm playing around with NextJS/Remix because it's easier to do and there's very little chance of me failing at it.

## What I'm planning to do
- Any new project that I start, I will have an achievable goal for it. Something that can be called "done".
	- _Achievable_ is different for everyone. Creating a small SaaS and have 5 people pay for it might be childs play for some, it's my Everest for now.
	- The plan is to aim for things just outside of my reach â€“ to work towards those and grow in the process.
- Have a deadline. For now I'm starting with 6 week cycles of project work.
- In order meet deadlines, I need to have a clear picture of the goal. Goes back to the first thing on this list. Having a clear definition of "done" is important. But being able to cut scope to achieve some version of the goal is also important.
	  - I've just finished reading Shape Up by Jason Fried and I like the Basecamp approach of deciding on an appetite (time commitment) to a project and cutting scope to meet that appetite.
	  - That's my plan moving forward. Each project I work on will be "shapped" into an achievable outcome and will have an allocated appetite - when I want to launch it or decide to abandon it. Continuing it for the next 6 week cycle will be another option but should be done sparingly.

This approach of timeboxing projects and having an achievable goal is also discussed by Zack Freedman in this video [Here's what's preventing you from finishing projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1j93RnIxEo). See it when you get the chance.

## This wasn't supposed to be a new years resolution
I started thinking about this over 2 months ago and have been planning to write a post on it. Today seemed like a good day for it. So I guess this is my new year's resolution. **Fail more, fail better.**
